//! A small local HTTP server, for tests that need a real socket without touching the internet.
//!
//! Only compiled when the `test-support` feature is on (the default). It is used by this
//! crate's own integration tests under `tests/`, and is exposed publicly so other crates in the
//! workspace (for example `postino-runner`, in a later phase) can depend on `postino-http` with
//! `features = ["test-support"]` and reuse the same helper instead of writing their own.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use postino_http::test_support::{StubResponse, TestServer};
//!
//! let server = TestServer::start();
//! let handle = server.serve(|_request| StubResponse::new(200).with_body("hello"));
//!
//! // ... send a request to `server.url()` here ...
//!
//! drop(server); // unblocks the server thread so `handle.join()` returns
//! handle.join().expect("server thread panicked");
//! ```
