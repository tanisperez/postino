///    replaced with `_`.
/// 2. Trailing dots and spaces are trimmed, since Windows does not allow them at the end of a
///    name.
/// 3. The name is truncated to [`MAX_NAME_LENGTH`] characters (counting Unicode scalar values,
///    not bytes, so a multi-byte character is never split), then trimmed again in case the
///    truncation left new trailing dots or spaces.
/// 4. If the result, compared case-insensitively, is a Windows-reserved device name (`CON`,
///    `PRN`, `COM1`, ...), an underscore is appended so it is safe to use.
/// 5. If nothing is left at this point, the name becomes `"untitled"`.
