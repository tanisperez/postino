//! The Git log tab (#174, design 4a): the filter, the pages of commits read so far with their
//! graph layout, the selected commit and its detail, and the rows of the branch column. Plain
//! data: `views/git/log_tab.rs` calls `postino-git` on the background executor and puts the
//! results here, render only reads them.
//!
//! The log is read in pages of [`PAGE_SIZE`] commits. Every page is laid out once when it
//! arrives (the [`GraphLayout`] continues across pages), so render never costs in proportion to
//! the history. Changing the filter bumps [`LogTab::generation`]: a page of an older generation
//! is dropped when it arrives.
