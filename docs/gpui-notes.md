# Working with gpui-kit

Findings about `gpui-kit` and `gpui` that are not obvious from their docs and cost time to
discover. Read this before touching theming, inputs, dialogs, charts or timers.

`gpui` changes quickly. Check the version pinned in `Cargo.toml` and read the real source under
`~/.cargo/registry/src/*/` (`gpui-kit`, `gpui-component`, `gpui-base`, `gpui-pre`) instead of
trusting memory or this file blindly. The findings below were first checked against `gpui-kit`
0.6.6, by compiling and running throwaway code and reading the sources. The project is now on
0.7.0, so a detail may have moved; where 0.7.0 is known to differ, it is said. Source locations
are given as `file:line` in the 0.6.6 crates and may have shifted.

## Themes

`Theme::change` only reads `Theme.light_theme` and `Theme.dark_theme`, and those default to the
two themes baked into `gpui-component`, not to whatever `ThemeRegistry::load_themes_from_str`
just loaded (that call only fills the by-name lookup map). So after loading a family, fetch the
two configs by name and assign them yourself, then call `Theme::change` again. Skipping this
silently keeps the built-in theme. This is what `theme::install` does.

- Load themes after `gpui_kit::init(cx)`, not before: `ThemeRegistry` is set up as a global
  inside `init`.
- `load_themes_from_str` silently skips a theme whose name is already in the registry, so
  calling it again with the same names does **not** reload. To change a theme live (font or size
  changes in Settings) parse the `ThemeConfig` JSON directly and assign it to
  `Theme::global_mut(cx).light_theme` / `.dark_theme`, as `theme::apply_settings` does.
- `Theme::sync_system_appearance(window, cx)` keeps working: it calls `Theme::change`, which
  re-reads the two fields above.

### Mapping a token to a theme field

Postino's own views never read `cx.theme()`: colors come from `Palette`. The theme JSON only
matters for the borrowed stock widgets (`TitleBar`, `Button`, `Dialog`, the scrollbar, `Input`
caret, selection and border, tree chevrons, checkboxes, switches). The mapping is built in
`theme/palette.rs` (`theme_colors_and_highlight`). The non-obvious points:

- `surface` has to be set on **three** keys, `sidebar.background`, `title_bar.background` and
  `tab_bar.background`. The title bar and tab bar fall back to `background`, not to the sidebar.
- `accent` goes to `primary.background`. gpui-component's own `accent.background` means
  something else (hover background on menu and list items) and must not receive the brand
  color; it gets `accent_subtle`, together with `selection.background` and
  `list.active.background`. Selection and active alpha are clamped by gpui itself, so pass an
  opaque color.
- `hover` has to be set on `list.hover.background`, `button.hover.background` and
  `table.hover.background`: the last two do not fall back to the first.
- `raised` maps to `secondary.background`, `overlay` to `popover.background`, `border_strong` to
  `input.border`, `accent_text` to `link`.
- The modal backdrop is a different field from the modal fill: the theme's `overlay` key is the
  scrim `Dialog` paints. Postino sets it transparent and paints its own scrim from
  `Palette::scrim`, so the fill and the scrim cannot be confused.
- Some tokens have **no** theme field and live only in `Palette`: `fg_subtle`, every
  `*_subtle` badge background, the five method colors and the shadow. The five `chart.N` slots
  are for charts, not HTTP methods, and reusing them would break the load test colors.
- Shadows are not colors: `ThemeConfig.shadow` is only an on/off switch. Keep the raw shadow
  values in `Palette` and apply them with `.shadow(vec![BoxShadow { .. }])` on menus, popovers
  and modals.

### Syntax highlight

`highlight.syntax` has one field per dotted capture name. Resolution is exact match first, then
it retries with everything before the first dot (`constant.builtin` falls back to `constant`,
`string.escape` to `string`). Captures emitted by the grammars Postino uses:

- JSON: `boolean`, `comment`, `constant.builtin`, `number`, `property` (object keys), `punctuation`,
  `string`, `string.escape`.
- JavaScript: `comment`, `constant`, `constant.builtin`, `embedded`, `function`,
  `function.builtin`, `function.method`, `keyword`, `number`, `operator`, `property`,
  `punctuation.*`, `string`, `string.special`, `type`, `variable`, `variable.builtin`. JavaScript
  `true` and `false` are `constant.builtin`, so they take the `constant` color, not `syn_bool`.
- HTML, used as the closest grammar for XML bodies: `attribute`, `comment`, `constant`,
  `punctuation.bracket`, `string`, `tag`, `tag.error`.

## Fonts

`cx.text_system().add_fonts(Vec<Cow<'static, [u8]>>)` registers TTF bytes, and
`all_font_names()` lists every installed family plus the ones added this way, which is the right
list for a font picker. Set `Theme.font_family`, `font_size`, `mono_font_family` and
`mono_font_size` to use them. There is no separate editor font setting: code editors read the
mono family.

## Icons

`gpui_component::IconName` is a small curated subset. The full Lucide catalog is
`gpui_kit::assets::IconName`. Both implement `IconNamed` and convert into `Icon`, so use
`Icon::new(gpui_kit::assets::IconName::SendHorizontal)` for any icon outside the subset. An icon
missing from the loaded asset set renders as empty space, silently; the app must be built with
`.with_assets(gpui_kit::assets::AllAssets)` (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Variable chips

**A single-line `Input` cannot style byte ranges.** `InputState` and `EditorState` are two
separate facades over one engine, and only the editor mode has a language and a highlighter. The
highlighter hooks compile on a plain `Input` but do nothing there. So the URL bar owns two
representations and picks one per render by focus: a read-only line of
`gpui::StyledText::with_highlights(runs)` when not focused, and the real `Input` when focused.
`HighlightStyle` supports a background color and a wavy underline in the same run, which is how a
defined `{{var}}` (accent background) and an unknown one (danger text, wavy underline) both
render from one call, using the byte ranges from `postino_core::variable_spans`.

**Inside a code editor, use text decorations.** `EditorState::create_decorations_collection`
returns a `TextDecorationCollection` of `TextDecoration { range, style: HighlightStyle }`. The
editor merges them with the syntax runs, so a `{{token}}` inside a JSON string keeps the string
color for the rest of the text. They follow edits, but `set_value` clears them, so set them again
after it (`views/request_editor.rs` does it when the variable context or the body text changes).
The tree-sitter `InputHighlighter` of `gpui-component` is `pub(crate)`, which is why wrapping it
was not an option.

**Hover tooltips.** A single-line field shows a plain `Tooltip` on each chip's `div`. The code
editor asks a `HoverProvider` (`state.lsp_mut().hover_provider`, then `state.refresh(cx)`), which
returns an `lsp_types::Hover` rendered as Markdown. Newlines of plain text collapse there, so the
provider uses a fenced first line and one paragraph per note (`views/variable_hover.rs`).

## Command palette

`gpui_component::command` (`Command`, `CommandItem`, `CommandGroup`, `CommandState`) is directly
usable and gives search, groups, icons, keywords, an action hint column, a checked state, arrow
navigation and Enter/Escape. Use `filterable(false)` plus an external filter when you need your
own ranking. There is no separate "palette" opener: put the `Command` inside a `Dialog`.

## Dialogs

There are two layers. `gpui_base::Dialog` is the low-level primitive. `gpui_component::dialog::
Dialog` is the ready-made wrapper (`.title`, `.content`, `.footer`, `.w`, `.overlay`,
`.overlay_closable`, `.keyboard` for Escape, `.close_button`, `.on_ok`/`.on_cancel`/`.on_close`).
Open it with `window.open_dialog(cx, |dialog, window, cx| ..)`. It centers itself and keeps a
margin from the window edges. Since 0.7.0 `Root` renders the dialog, sheet and notification
layers itself, so views must not render them again (see `AGENTS.md`).

## Single-line inputs

An `Input` has a default height of 32 px (`h_8`) and a default vertical padding of 8 px, which
leaves 16 px for a line that is 20 px tall. The text is clipped to that content box, so the bottom
of every descender is cut (`Content-Type` reads as `Content-Tvbe`, `application/json` as
`application/ison`), at any display scale. Always call `.py_0()` on a single-line `Input`, with or
without a fixed `.h(..)`, or build it with `components::text_field`. Making the box taller does not
help, only the padding matters. Found in #67; the sample suite request `headers/custom` shows the
header table, which is the quickest place to check it.

## Charts

`chart::LineChart` is a **single-series** element whose y scale always starts at 0 and is built
from its own data. There is no dual-axis mode. That is exactly what two series "each normalized
to its own max" need: stack two `LineChart`s with `.absolute()` inside the same bounds, each with
`x_axis(false)` and `grid(false)`. The `Y` type must be `f64`; there is no `f32` implementation,
so keep metrics as `f64` before handing them to a chart. Histograms and status-code bars need no
chart widget: plain `div()`s with a computed size and a background color.

## Periodic work

There is no standalone timer type. Use `cx.background_executor().timer(duration)` inside a
`cx.spawn`. For a refresh that runs only while something is active (the load test dashboard,
every 250 ms), a plain loop in one `cx.spawn` is enough; dropping the `Task` cancels it. A task
that reschedules itself needs an epoch counter so a stale reschedule becomes a no-op instead of
two timers racing (the cursor blink does this). Remember the idle rule: a timer that calls
`cx.notify()` while nothing changes re-renders the whole window.

## Title bar and window controls

`TitleBar` appends the platform's `WindowControls` itself, as the last child. On macOS it renders
nothing and the OS traffic lights stay. On Linux under server-side decorations it renders
nothing, so the controls never double up with the compositor's. Under real client-side
decorations it renders minimize, maximize and close, but only the ones the window manager
reports as supported. So `TitleBar::new().child(..)` with the app's own content is the whole
implementation, with `WindowDecorations::Client` in the window options on Linux.

## Debug hooks

`POSTINO_ENV`, `POSTINO_AUTOSEND` and `POSTINO_OPEN` are read once at startup, do nothing when
unset, appear in no menu and are not a supported feature. They exist so a screenshot of a given
UI state can be taken without clicking (`POSTINO_OPEN` takes `components`, `settings`,
`settings-requests`, `settings-advanced`, `settings-about`, `palette`, `snippet`, `define`,
`loadtest` or `env:<name>`; see `state/debug_open.rs`). Opening a dialog needs a `Window`, so the hook runs where a window is
available.
